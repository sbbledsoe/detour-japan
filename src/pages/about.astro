      <h1>About Detour Japan</h1>

      <p>
        Japan has 47 prefectures, but most visitors only see a handful. Tokyo's neon lights,
        Kyoto's golden temples, and Osaka's food scene draw millions every year. But what about
        the other 44 prefectures?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Detour Japan</strong> exists to shine a light on the places tourists miss.
        We explore forgotten castle towns, hidden mountain shrines, coastal villages where
        fishing boats still return each morning, and rural stations where you might be the
        only foreigner to visit all year.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Cover</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hidden Destinations</strong> &ndash; Places that don't appear in typical guidebooks</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation Guides</strong> &ndash; How to reach remote areas using Japan's excellent public transit</li>
        <li><strong>Budget Tips</strong> &ndash; Travel smart without breaking the bank</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal Insights</strong> &ndash; The best times to visit each location</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>

      <p>
        Every destination we feature is accessible by public transportation. No rental car needed.
        We believe Japan's train and bus networks are part of the adventure, not an obstacle to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We prioritize authenticity over popularity. A quiet temple with two other visitors beats
        a famous one with two hundred. A local izakaya with handwritten menus offers more than
        a tourist-friendly restaurant with English photos.
      </p>

      <div class="transport-box">
        <h4>Getting Off the Beaten Path</h4>
        <p>
          The JR Pass opens doors, but don't overlook local bus lines, community shuttles, and
          even walking routes. Some of Japan's best experiences are found at the end of a
          single-track railway line.
        </p>

      <h2>Join the Detour</h2>

      <p>
        Whether you're planning your first trip to Japan or your tenth, we hope Detour Japan
        inspires you to venture beyond the obvious. The real Japan isn't hiding &ndash; it's
        just waiting for you to look.
